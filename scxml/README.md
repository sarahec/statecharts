# Implementation plan

1. Verify all XML elements parse correctly
2. Verify runtime behavior (using function expressions where needed)
3. Add compiler extentions to generated elements (e.g. string templates)
4. Run the stage 3 code through the analyzer to identify needed runtime vars
5. Emit finished source including runtime environment
