# Statecharts

Why another state machine / statecharts package? I was looking for something akin to the Flutter view hierarchy — declarative, immutable, and a good candidate for implementing [SCXML](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) via [instant_xml_parser](https://pub.dev/packages/instant_xml_parser).

(Note that SCXML hasn't been implemented yet)
